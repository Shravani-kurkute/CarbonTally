# 🌱 CarbonTally

**CarbonTally** is a sustainability-focused project aimed at quantifying and analyzing carbon emissions in industrial sectors. The tool helps track carbon footprints, evaluate existing carbon sinks, and suggest actionable strategies to move towards carbon neutrality.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Industries are one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, but many lack the tools to quantify, monitor, and reduce their carbon impact. There's a strong need for a data-driven solution to estimate emissions, identify gaps, and propose pathways to carbon neutrality.

---

## 🔍 What CarbonTally Does

- 📊 **Estimates emissions** from various activities (e.g., machinery, transport, energy use)
- 🌲 **Calculates existing carbon sinks** (like afforestation, soil storage)
- 📉 **Performs gap analysis** between emissions vs sinks
- 🚀 **Suggests actionable strategies** for reduction and neutrality
- 📈 **Visualizes emission trends** through dashboards
- 🔄 **Tracks progress** of carbon reduction efforts over time

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React optional)
- **Backend**: Python / Node.js
- **Data Storage**: JSON / Firebase / MongoDB
- **Visualization**: Chart.js / D3.js / Google Charts
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Canva, Figma

## 🌐 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **User Inputs Data**  
   → Activities, equipment, frequency, energy use, etc.

2. **Backend Estimates Emissions**  
   → Using emission factors and formulas

3. **Sink Estimation & Gap Analysis**  
   → Calculates carbon offsets and finds the emission-sink gap

4. **Suggestions Engine**  
   → Provides reduction strategies and possible carbon credits

5. **Dashboard Visualization**  
   → Graphs, tables, and progress charts
